so actually what you should do

is just only use embeddings for possible responses to an investigatory chatbot

generate the questions using GPT4, and then write your responses to theme

have the question and the response get embedded for the bot to choose from your writing or rework the ideas in the embedding itself


1. get the prompt to emulate your writing style and beliefs
2. create an embeddings flow for those beliefs
3. take a piece of your writing about something and generate some questions that could be answered by itself
4. embed the shits and get them into an in memory array in node
5. get some embeddings search to work.
